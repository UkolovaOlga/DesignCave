# Design cave
**Bitcoin is a luxury.** It's the core of New Economy. It's the fundamental part of an individual. 
And being a sovereign individual is expensive and demands a lot of resources.
You need to have patience and open mind to learn new things. You need to have creativity and diligence to create new tools. 
You need to have resources and weapons to defend your Self and your property. And you need to spend all that on one thing - 
becoming invulnerable. 

Hovewer, regardless the price one needs to pay, more and more people have been choosing the compellingly-solid luxury of Bitcoin 
over familiar illusions of consumerism. 

But we are still far from mass adoption.
As a technology, Bitcoin has shown great potential to cover many use cases: from storing wealth to issuing digital assets 
and tokenizing lambos. 
Nowadays we are witnessing new protocols, business models and products appearing on top of it, leveraging its strengths and balancing out 
the weaknesses.
There are multiple technical challenges that developers have been bravely fighting on the protocol level, 
in the name of freedom and sovereignity.
Hovewer, there is another battle that Bitcoin has been involved in - **The battle for users hearts**. 

This repository was created with the idea to start an initiative, that has not been present in the Bitcoin space: 
**collaboration between cypherpunks, developers, designers and product managers in order to give birth to new generation of applications 
and products: secure, private and beautiful**.

### Let the unholy "UX/UI vs. security" war end here! ᕙ(`▿´)ᕗ

As the first step, I'm creating a knowledge base in this repository. It will contain different materials on the following topics:
* UX
* UI
* lettering
* branding
* human behavioral patterns
* human-computer interaction
* colors and structures 
* human factors
* design history

Feel free to reach out and contribute!
